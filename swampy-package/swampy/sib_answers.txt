Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:

1) imports all modules from the TurtleWorld.py script
2) makes a Canvas object
3) makes a Turtle object called bob
4) waits for the user input





These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: pu, fd, pd and then lt

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: rt, pu, and bk

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: post-condition
